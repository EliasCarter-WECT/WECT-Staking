# scure-bip39

<<<<<<< HEAD
Audited & minimal JS implementation of [BIP39 mnemonic phrases](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039.mediawiki).

- ðŸ”’ [**Audited**](#security) by an independent security firm
- ðŸ”» Tree-shaking-friendly: use only what's necessary, other code won't be included
- ðŸ“¦ ESM and common.js
- âž° Only 2 audited dependencies by the same author:
  [noble-hashes](https://github.com/paulmillr/noble-hashes) and [scure-base](https://github.com/paulmillr/scure-base)
- ðŸª¶ 37KB with all deps bundled and 279KB with wordlists: much smaller than similar libraries
=======
Secure, [audited](#security) & minimal implementation of BIP39 mnemonic phrases.

Compared to popular `bip39` package, scure-bip39:

- Is 491KB all-bundled instead of 1.3MB
- Uses 2 dependencies instead of 15
- Wordlists are 157KB instead of 315KB
- Had an external security [audit](#security) by Cure53 on Jan 5, 2022

## Usage

> npm install @scure/bip39

<<<<<<< HEAD
=======
Or

> yarn add @scure/bip39

>>>>>>> ba11e9b4e (Initial commit after reset)
```js
import * as bip39 from '@scure/bip39';
import { wordlist } from '@scure/bip39/wordlists/english';

// Generate x random words. Uses Cryptographically-Secure Random Number Generator.
const mn = bip39.generateMnemonic(wordlist);
console.log(mn);

// Reversible: Converts mnemonic string to raw entropy in form of byte array.
const ent = bip39.mnemonicToEntropy(mn, wordlist)

// Reversible: Converts raw entropy in form of byte array to mnemonic string.
bip39.entropyToMnemonic(ent, wordlist);

// Validates mnemonic for being 12-24 words contained in `wordlist`.
bip39.validateMnemonic(mn, wordlist);

// Irreversible: Uses KDF to derive 64 bytes of key data from mnemonic + optional password.
await bip39.mnemonicToSeed(mn, 'password');
bip39.mnemonicToSeedSync(mn, 'password');
```

<<<<<<< HEAD
This submodule contains the word lists defined by BIP39 for Czech, English, French, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, Simplified and Traditional Chinese, and Spanish. These are not imported by default, as that would increase bundle sizes too much. Instead, you should import and use them explicitly.

## Security

<<<<<<< HEAD
To audit wordlist content, run `node scripts/fetch-wordlist.js`.

The library has been independently audited:

- at version 1.0.0, in Jan 2022, by [cure53](https://cure53.de)
  - PDFs: [online](https://cure53.de/pentest-report_hashing-libs.pdf), [offline](./audit/2022-01-05-cure53-audit-nbl2.pdf)
  - [Changes since audit](https://github.com/paulmillr/scure-bip39/compare/1.0.0..main).
  - The audit has been funded by [Ethereum Foundation](https://ethereum.org/en/) with help of [Nomic Labs](https://nomiclabs.io)

The library was initially developed for [js-ethereum-cryptography](https://github.com/ethereum/js-ethereum-cryptography).
At commit [ae00e6d7](https://github.com/ethereum/js-ethereum-cryptography/commit/ae00e6d7d24fb3c76a1c7fe10039f6ecd120b77e),
it was extracted to a separate package called `micro-bip39`.
After the audit we've decided to use `@scure` NPM namespace for security.
