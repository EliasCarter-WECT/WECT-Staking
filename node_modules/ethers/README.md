Documentation

Providers
---------

Ethers works closely with an ever-growing list of third-party providers
to ensure getting started is quick and easy, by providing default keys
to each service.

These built-in keys mean you can use `ethers.getDefaultProvider()` and
start developing right away.

However, the API keys provided to ethers are also shared and are
intentionally throttled to encourage developers to eventually get
their own keys, which unlock many other features, such as faster
responses, more capacity, analytics and other features like archival
data.

When you are ready to sign up and start using for your own keys, please
check out the [Provider API Keys](https://docs.ethers.org/v5/api-keys/) in
the documentation.

A special thanks to these services for providing community resources:

Extension Packages
------------------

The `ethers` package only includes the most common and most core
functionality to interact with Ethereum. There are many other
packages designed to further enhance the functionality and experience.

- [MulticallProvider](https://github.com/ethers-io/ext-provider-multicall) - A Provider which bundles multiple call requests into a single `call` to reduce latency and backend request capacity
- [MulticoinPlugin](https://github.com/ethers-io/ext-provider-plugin-multicoin) - A Provider plugin to expand the support of ENS coin types
- [GanaceProvider](https://github.com/ethers-io/ext-provider-ganache) - A Provider for in-memory node instances, for fast debugging, testing and simulating blockchain operations
- [Optimism Utilities](https://github.com/ethers-io/ext-utils-optimism) - A collection of Optimism utilities
- [LedgerSigner](https://github.com/ethers-io/ext-signer-ledger) - A Signer to interact directly with Ledger Hardware Wallets

Browse the [documentation](https://docs.ethers.io/v5/) online:

- [Getting Started](https://docs.ethers.io/v5/getting-started/)
- [Full API Documentation](https://docs.ethers.io/v5/api/)
- [Various Ethereum Articles](https://blog.ricmoo.com/)

Or browse the entire documentation as a [single page](https://docs.ethers.io/v5/single-page/) to make searching easier.


Ancillary Packages
------------------

These are a number of packages not included in the umbrella `ethers` npm package, and
additional packages are always being added. Often these packages are for specific
use-cases, so rather than adding them to the umbrella package, they are added as
ancillary packages, which can be included by those who need them, while not bloating
everyone else with packages they do not need.

We will keep a list of useful packages here.

- `@ethersproject/experimental` ([documentation](https://docs.ethers.io))
- `@ethersproject/cli` ([documentation](https://docs.ethers.io))
- `@ethersproject/hardware-wallets` ([documentation](https://docs.ethers.io))
