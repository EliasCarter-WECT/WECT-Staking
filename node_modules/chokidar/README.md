# Chokidar [![Weekly downloads](https://img.shields.io/npm/dw/chokidar.svg)](https://github.com/paulmillr/chokidar)

> Minimal and efficient cross-platform file watching library

## Why?

There are many reasons to prefer Chokidar to raw fs.watch / fs.watchFile in 2024:

- Events are properly reported
    - macOS events report filenames
    - events are not reported twice
    - changes are reported as add / change / unlink instead of useless `rename`
- Atomic writes are supported, using `atomic` option
    - Some file editors use them
- Chunked writes are supported, using `awaitWriteFinish` option
    - Large files are commonly written in chunks
- File / dir filtering is supported
- Symbolic links are supported
- Recursive watching is always supported, instead of partial when using raw events
    - Includes a way to limit recursion depth

Chokidar relies on the Node.js core `fs` module, but when using
`fs.watch` and `fs.watchFile` for watching, it normalizes the events it
receives, often checking for truth by getting file stats and/or dir contents.
The `fs.watch`-based implementation is the default, which
avoids polling and keeps CPU usage down. Be advised that chokidar will initiate
watchers recursively for everything within scope of the paths that have been
specified, so be judicious about not wasting system resources by watching much
more than needed. For some cases, `fs.watchFile`, which utilizes polling and uses more resources, is used.

Made for [Brunch](https://brunch.io/) in 2012,
it is now used in [~30 million repositories](https://www.npmjs.com/browse/depended/chokidar) and
has proven itself in production environments.

**Sep 2024 update:** v4 is out! It decreases dependency count from 13 to 1, removes
support for globs, adds support for ESM / Common.js modules, and bumps minimum node.js version from v8 to v14.

> A neat wrapper around node.js fs.watch / fs.watchFile / FSEvents.

[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/chokidar.png)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/chokidar)

## Why?
Node.js `fs.watch`:

* Doesn't report filenames on MacOS.
* Doesn't report events at all when using editors like Sublime on MacOS.
* Often reports events twice.
* Emits most changes as `rename`.
* Has [a lot of other issues](https://github.com/nodejs/node/search?q=fs.watch&type=Issues)
* Does not provide an easy way to recursively watch file trees.

Node.js `fs.watchFile`:

* Almost as bad at event handling.
* Also does not provide any recursive watching.
* Results in high CPU utilization.

Chokidar resolves these problems.

Initially made for **[Brunch](http://brunch.io)** (an ultra-swift web app build tool), it is now used in
[gulp](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/),
[karma](http://karma-runner.github.io),
[PM2](https://github.com/Unitech/PM2),
[browserify](http://browserify.org/),
[webpack](http://webpack.github.io/),
[BrowserSync](http://www.browsersync.io/),
[Microsoft's Visual Studio Code](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode),
and [many others](https://www.npmjs.org/browse/depended/chokidar/).
It has proven itself in production environments.

## How?
Chokidar does still rely on the Node.js core `fs` module, but when using
`fs.watch` and `fs.watchFile` for watching, it normalizes the events it
receives, often checking for truth by getting file stats and/or dir contents.

On MacOS, chokidar by default uses a native extension exposing the Darwin
`FSEvents` API. This provides very efficient recursive watching compared with
implementations like `kqueue` available on most \*nix platforms. Chokidar still
does have to do some work to normalize the events received that way as well.

On other platforms, the `fs.watch`-based implementation is the default, which
avoids polling and keeps CPU usage down. Be advised that chokidar will initiate
watchers recursively for everything within scope of the paths that have been
specified, so be judicious about not wasting system resources by watching much
more than needed.

=======
## API

`chokidar.watch(paths, [options])`

* `paths` (string or array of strings). Paths to files, dirs to be watched
recursively, or glob patterns.
>>>>>>> ba11e9b4e (Initial commit after reset)
* `options` (object) Options object as defined below:

#### Persistence

* `persistent` (default: `true`). Indicates whether the process
<<<<<<< HEAD
should continue to run as long as files are being watched.

#### Path filtering

* `ignored` function, regex, or path. Defines files/paths to be ignored.
The whole relative or absolute path is tested, not just filename. If a function with two arguments
is provided, it gets called twice per path - once with a single argument (the path), second
time with two arguments (the path and the
[`fs.Stats`](https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_class_fs_stats)
=======
should continue to run as long as files are being watched. If set to
`false` when using `fsevents` to watch, no more events will be emitted
after `ready`, even if the process continues to run.

#### Path filtering

* `ignored` ([anymatch](https://github.com/es128/anymatch)-compatible definition)
Defines files/paths to be ignored. The whole relative or absolute path is
tested, not just filename. If a function with two arguments is provided, it
gets called twice per path - once with a single argument (the path), second
time with two arguments (the path and the
[`fs.Stats`](http://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_class_fs_stats)
>>>>>>> ba11e9b4e (Initial commit after reset)
object of that path).
* `ignoreInitial` (default: `false`). If set to `false` then `add`/`addDir` events are also emitted for matching paths while
instantiating the watching as chokidar discovers these file paths (before the `ready` event).
* `followSymlinks` (default: `true`). When `false`, only the
symlinks themselves will be watched for changes instead of following
the link references and bubbling events through the link's path.
* `cwd` (no default). The base directory from which watch `paths` are to be
derived. Paths emitted with events will be relative to this.
<<<<<<< HEAD
=======
* `disableGlobbing` (default: `false`). If set to `true` then the strings passed to `.watch()` and `.add()` are treated as
literal path names, even if they look like globs.
>>>>>>> ba11e9b4e (Initial commit after reset)

#### Performance

* `usePolling` (default: `false`).
Whether to use fs.watchFile (backed by polling), or fs.watch. If polling
leads to high CPU utilization, consider setting this to `false`. It is
typically necessary to **set this to `true` to successfully watch files over
a network**, and it may be necessary to successfully watch files in other
non-standard situations. Setting to `true` explicitly on MacOS overrides the
`useFsEvents` default. You may also set the CHOKIDAR_USEPOLLING env variable
to true (1) or false (0) in order to override this option.
* _Polling-specific settings_ (effective when `usePolling: true`)
<<<<<<< HEAD
  * `interval` (default: `100`). Interval of file system polling, in milliseconds. You may also
=======
  * `interval` (default: `100`). Interval of file system polling. You may also
>>>>>>> ba11e9b4e (Initial commit after reset)
    set the CHOKIDAR_INTERVAL env variable to override this option.
  * `binaryInterval` (default: `300`). Interval of file system
  polling for binary files.
  ([see list of binary extensions](https://github.com/sindresorhus/binary-extensions/blob/master/binary-extensions.json))
<<<<<<< HEAD
* `alwaysStat` (default: `false`). If relying upon the
[`fs.Stats`](https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_class_fs_stats)
=======
* `useFsEvents` (default: `true` on MacOS). Whether to use the
`fsevents` watching interface if available. When set to `true` explicitly
and `fsevents` is available this supercedes the `usePolling` setting. When
set to `false` on MacOS, `usePolling: true` becomes the default.
* `alwaysStat` (default: `false`). If relying upon the
[`fs.Stats`](http://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_class_fs_stats)
>>>>>>> ba11e9b4e (Initial commit after reset)
object that may get passed with `add`, `addDir`, and `change` events, set
this to `true` to ensure it is provided even in cases where it wasn't
already available from the underlying watch events.
* `depth` (default: `undefined`). If set, limits how many levels of
subdirectories will be traversed.
* `awaitWriteFinish` (default: `false`).
By default, the `add` event will fire when a file first appears on disk, before
the entire file has been written. Furthermore, in some cases some `change`
events will be emitted while the file is being written. In some cases,
especially when watching for large files there will be a need to wait for the
write operation to finish before responding to a file creation or modification.
Setting `awaitWriteFinish` to `true` (or a truthy value) will poll file size,
holding its `add` and `change` events until the size does not change for a
configurable amount of time. The appropriate duration setting is heavily
dependent on the OS and hardware. For accurate detection this parameter should
be relatively high, making file watching much less responsive.
Use with caution.
  * *`options.awaitWriteFinish` can be set to an object in order to adjust
  timing params:*
  * `awaitWriteFinish.stabilityThreshold` (default: 2000). Amount of time in
  milliseconds for a file size to remain constant before emitting its event.
<<<<<<< HEAD
  * `awaitWriteFinish.pollInterval` (default: 100). File size polling interval, in milliseconds.

#### Errors

=======
  * `awaitWriteFinish.pollInterval` (default: 100). File size polling interval.

#### Errors
>>>>>>> ba11e9b4e (Initial commit after reset)
* `ignorePermissionErrors` (default: `false`). Indicates whether to watch files
that don't have read permissions if possible. If watching fails due to `EPERM`
or `EACCES` with this set to `true`, the errors will be suppressed silently.
* `atomic` (default: `true` if `useFsEvents` and `usePolling` are `false`).
Automatically filters out artifacts that occur when using editors that use
"atomic writes" instead of writing directly to the source file. If a file is
re-added within 100 ms of being deleted, Chokidar emits a `change` event
rather than `unlink` then `add`. If the default of 100 ms does not work well
for you, you can override it by setting `atomic` to a custom value, in
milliseconds.

### Methods & Events

`chokidar.watch()` produces an instance of `FSWatcher`. Methods of `FSWatcher`:

<<<<<<< HEAD
* `.add(path / paths)`: Add files, directories for tracking.
=======
* `.add(path / paths)`: Add files, directories, or glob patterns for tracking.
>>>>>>> ba11e9b4e (Initial commit after reset)
Takes an array of strings or just one string.
* `.on(event, callback)`: Listen for an FS event.
Available events: `add`, `addDir`, `change`, `unlink`, `unlinkDir`, `ready`,
`raw`, `error`.
Additionally `all` is available which gets emitted with the underlying event
<<<<<<< HEAD
name and path for every event other than `ready`, `raw`, and `error`.  `raw` is internal, use it carefully.
* `.unwatch(path / paths)`: Stop watching files or directories.
Takes an array of strings or just one string.
* `.close()`: **async** Removes all listeners from watched files. Asynchronous, returns Promise. Use with `await` to ensure bugs don't happen.
=======
name and path for every event other than `ready`, `raw`, and `error`.
* `.unwatch(path / paths)`: Stop watching files, directories, or glob patterns.
Takes an array of strings or just one string.
* `.close()`: Removes all listeners from watched files.
>>>>>>> ba11e9b4e (Initial commit after reset)
* `.getWatched()`: Returns an object representing all the paths on the file
system being watched by this `FSWatcher` instance. The object's keys are all the
directories (using absolute paths unless the `cwd` option was used), and the
values are arrays of the names of the items contained in each directory.

### CLI

Check out third party [chokidar-cli](https://github.com/open-cli-tools/chokidar-cli),
which allows to execute a command on each change, or get a stdio stream of change events.

## Troubleshooting

Sometimes, Chokidar runs out of file handles, causing `EMFILE` and `ENOSP` errors:

* `bash: cannot set terminal process group (-1): Inappropriate ioctl for device bash: no job control in this shell`
* `Error: watch /home/ ENOSPC`

There are two things that can cause it.

1. Exhausted file handles for generic fs operations
    - Can be solved by using [graceful-fs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/graceful-fs),
      which can monkey-patch native `fs` module used by chokidar: `let fs = require('fs'); let grfs = require('graceful-fs'); grfs.gracefulify(fs);`
    - Can also be solved by tuning OS: `echo fs.inotify.max_user_watches=524288 | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf && sudo sysctl -p`.
2. Exhausted file handles for `fs.watch`
    - Can't seem to be solved by graceful-fs or OS tuning
    - It's possible to start using `usePolling: true`, which will switch backend to resource-intensive `fs.watchFile`

All fsevents-related issues (`WARN optional dep failed`, `fsevents is not a constructor`) are solved by upgrading to v4+.

## Changelog

- **v4 (Sep 2024):** remove glob support and bundled fsevents. Decrease dependency count from 13 to 1. Rewrite in typescript. Bumps minimum node.js requirement to v14+
- **v3 (Apr 2019):** massive CPU & RAM consumption improvements; reduces deps / package size by a factor of 17x and bumps Node.js requirement to v8.16+.
- **v2 (Dec 2017):** globs are now posix-style-only. Tons of bugfixes.
- **v1 (Apr 2015):** glob support, symlink support, tons of bugfixes. Node 0.8+ is supported
- **v0.1 (Apr 2012):** Initial release, extracted from [Brunch](https://github.com/brunch/brunch/blob/9847a065aea300da99bd0753f90354cde9de1261/src/helpers.coffee#L66)

### Upgrading

If you've used globs before and want do replicate the functionality with v4:

```js
// v3
chok.watch('**/*.js');
chok.watch("./directory/**/*");

// v4
chok.watch('.', {
  ignored: (path, stats) => stats?.isFile() && !path.endsWith('.js'), // only watch js files
});
chok.watch('./directory');

// other way
import { glob } from 'node:fs/promises';
const watcher = watch(await Array.fromAsync(glob('**/*.js')));

// unwatching
// v3
chok.unwatch('**/*.js');
// v4
chok.unwatch(await glob('**/*.js'));
```

## Also

Why was chokidar named this way? What's the meaning behind it?

>Chowkidar is a transliteration of a Hindi word meaning 'watchman, gatekeeper', चौकीदार. This ultimately comes from Sanskrit _ चतुष्क_ (crossway, quadrangle, consisting-of-four). This word is also used in other languages like Urdu as (چوکیدار) which is widely used in Pakistan and India.

## Install Troubleshooting

* `npm WARN optional dep failed, continuing fsevents@n.n.n`
  * This message is normal part of how `npm` handles optional dependencies and is
    not indicative of a problem. Even if accompanied by other related error messages,
    Chokidar should function properly.

* `ERR! stack Error: Python executable "python" is v3.4.1, which is not supported by gyp.`
  * You should be able to resolve this by installing python 2.7 and running:
    `npm config set python python2.7`

* `gyp ERR! stack Error: not found: make`
  * On Mac, install the XCode command-line tools
